# Force-directed-graph-drawing
Draw a graph using net forces (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing)
And run BFS on a graph

Source.cpp parses input (by default input.txt)

GraphGUI.cpp builds graph

Algorithms.cpp finds shortest path between two vertices (BFS)

Project uses SFML library (https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
