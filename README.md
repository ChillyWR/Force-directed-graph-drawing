# Force-directed-graph-drawing
Draw a graph using net forces (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing)
And run BFS on a graph.

Source.cpp parses input (by default input.txt).

Algorithms.cpp finds shortest path between two vertices (BFS).

GraphGUI.cpp builds graph and enlightens path found by BSF.
"Enter" key is bound to show each edge on the path.

Project uses SFML library (https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
